### Repository

This repository is a Open Tibia based library focused in centralize common libraries over different Open Tibia ressources like: servers, clients and tools.

Initially focused in centralize shared common static configurations (enums, consts, protocol codes, utils functions), it has the intention on going even further, centralizing base shared classes and protocol format.
